# Join the Team

If you are a University of New Haven student interested in competiting, reach out to the president or captain in Discord about how you can start preparing. Watch for announcements about upcoming competitions. If you are able, attend the weekly club meetings as they are a great source of practice for competitions.

If you still feel underprepated to compete, the best method to learn something is by doing it. Many of the team members were beginners when they joined but improved over time by competing.
